The biggest source of infection is e-mail attachments. Opened by the unwary, they can contain a toxic payload of mischief-making software which wreaks havoc, stealing or corrupting data. Luckily, screening attachments is getting easier. One option is to quarantine them. Even better is to strip them down and rebuild them safely as standardised documents with no room for malware\u2014an approach pioneered by Glasswall, a British company.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",{"component":"AdvertisementPanel","props":{"adTag":"\/5605\/theworldin","sizes":[[0,0]],"sizeMapping":[[[1024,1],[[1024,768],[970,250],[728,90]]],[[768,1],[[728,90],[300,250]]],[[320,1],[[300,250],[1,1]]]],"reserveHeight":100}},"\u003Cp\u003EAttackers will still get in (too much badly designed hardware and software is out there, and seemingly innocent websites can be doctored to infect computers that visit them). The only safe assumption is that your network is breached, and to make sure that you deal with intruders promptly\u2014not after the 200-odd days which it typically takes. Many networks have no means of detecting a breach at all. And old-style cyber-security generates too many alerts: \u201cfalse positives\u201d, in the jargon. When a burglar alarm rings constantly, people ignore it. Now the combination of cleverer algorithms, better data collection, cheaper storage and greater processing power makes it easier to automate the detection of anomalous behaviour, and to work out who is up to what. Watch out for companies in this field such as Vectra Networks, in San Jose, California.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","\u003Cp\u003EA third big shift is virtualisation. Instead of running a network of lots of computers, any one of which can be infected, you run lots of sessions off one big server\u2014in effect replicating each user\u2019s machine with software. Virtual sessions are much easier to monitor than a physical computer: you can make sure each user has up-to-date software, and is behaving sensibly.

Attackers\u2014whether they are spies, criminals or pranksters\u2014are people. And like all people, they are vulnerable to the tricks of the spy trade. Defenders can turn the tables on them, infiltrating the chat rooms and marketplaces where they do business. Honeypots and honeynets (phoney targets designed to lure attackers onto a network) give the defenders a chance to identify their enemies and work out what they are up to.

He came up with the idea of mooring a pair of long, floating barriers out at sea, facing into the prevailing current in a shallow arc. As the sea brought junk up to the barrier it would bob along the arms and towards the centre, where it would build up until it could be hauled out of the water in bulk. The moving water does the work of concentrating the rubbish and living creatures pass safely under the boom.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","\u003Cp\u003EAfter his 2012 talk at a \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-variant: small-caps;\u0022\u003ETED\u003C\/span\u003Ex conference went viral, Mr Slat attracted engineers, oceanographers and donors. Tests of 40-metre-long booms provided proof of the concept, and a 535-page technical review written by over 100 scientists, engineers and companies muted objections that the technology could not be scaled up. The big test will come in 2016, when Mr Slat turns 22 years old, with the 2km boom being readied for Tsushima, an island which sees some 12,000 cubic metres of junk washed onto its beaches each year.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","\u003Cp\u003EThe project is already intensifying the debate over ocean garbage.

In high and low culture, Germany has become unimaginable without such \u201cforeign\u201d influences. When Germany won the football World Cup in 1990, all its national players were Bio-Deutsche.

The centre-right Christian Democratic Union, led by Angela Merkel, and its conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, insist on the fiction that Germany does not have permanent \u201cimmigrants\u201d (\u003Cem\u003EEinwanderer)\u003C\/em\u003E but rather temporary \u201cin-comers\u201d (\u003Cem\u003EZuwanderer\u003C\/em\u003E), such as guest workers, who will one day leave.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","\u003Cp\u003EThis is a travesty of reality and deserves the ridicule that the centre-left parties are meting out. In 2014 a law was tweaked that makes it easier for most children born in Germany to foreign parents to keep both citizenships indefinitely.
